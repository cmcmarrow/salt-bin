Docker Build
============

THIS IS AN OLD BUILD INSTRUCTION, IT IS HERE UNTIL I CAN GET NEWER PYTHONS
TO RUN ON PYENV WITH OLD CENTOS.

DO NOT USE THIS TUTORIAL

It may be desireable to build the binary in a docker container. For instance
building in a centos 6 container should product a more portable binary.

`salt-bin` comes with a script for building  in centos 6 with a newer python.
To build make a new docker container:

docker run -it centos:6 bash

Then copy the files into the container:

docker cp . <container name>:/opt

Then run the build:

cd /opt

bash scripts/cent6_setup.sh

The results will be in the dist directory where they can be coppied back out with
the docker cp command:

docker cp <container name>:/opt/dist .
